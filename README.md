## how to run 

1. Locate your images: define `path_in` and `path_out`, the folders containing images should be put in `path_in`. One thing you should know is that the code is capable of handling multiple folders containing images, so finally you will obtain multiple pdf files.
2. Run the python code `img2pdf` with `python img2pdf.py`.
3. Check out the `path_out` and you can obtain the pdf files if the code runs successfully.
